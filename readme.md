# This is Version 2.0 of Beam Calculator
Here I improve User Interface, the beam design and the diagrams.

# Structural Analysis Beam Tool

This project is an interactive **Beam Analysis Tool** developed in **Python** using **Streamlit**. The tool provides an intuitive interface for defining beams, supports, point loads, and distributed loads. Users can visualize shear force diagrams (SFD) and bending moment diagrams (BMD) for a given beam configuration.

## Key Features:
- **Dynamic Input Interface**: Add supports, point loads, and distributed loads with ease.
- **Visualization**: Generate real-time SFD and BMD based on user inputs.
- **Customizability**: Modify loads and beam properties interactively.
- **Engineering Calculations**: Includes reactions, moments, and shear force computations.
- **User-Friendly**: Minimalistic and easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Purpose:
This project is designed for students, engineers, and enthusiasts to quickly analyze simple beam structures. It helps in understanding load distribution and structural behavior under various load conditions.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or fork this repository to build your own version of the tool!
